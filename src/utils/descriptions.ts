  'Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM₂.₅)': 'Fine inhalable particles with diameters ≤ 2.5 micrometers. PM₂.₅ originates from sources like vehicle exhaust, industrial emissions, wildfires, and chemical reactions in the atmosphere. These particles penetrate deep into the lungs and can enter the bloodstream, contributing to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and premature death.',
  'Particulate Matter 10 (PM₁₀)': 'Coarse particles with diameters ≤ 10 micrometers but larger than PM₂.₅. PM₁₀ includes dust, pollen, mold, and other materials from roads, agriculture, and construction. While less penetrating than PM₂.₅, they still affect respiratory function, especially in children and people with asthma or chronic lung disease.',
  'Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂)': 'A reddish-brown gas primarily produced by vehicle engines and combustion of fossil fuels. NO₂ is part of the group of nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) and a key component of urban smog. Short-term exposure inflames airways and worsens asthma; long-term exposure may contribute to respiratory infections and reduced lung development in children.',
  'Sulphur Dioxide (SO₂)': 'A colorless gas with a sharp odor, produced largely from burning fossil fuels containing sulfur (e.g., coal, oil). SO₂ irritates the respiratory system, particularly during physical activity. It is a precursor to acid rain and fine particulate matter (via sulfate formation in the atmosphere).',
  'Ozone (O₃)': 'A secondary pollutant formed by sunlight-driven reactions between NOₓ and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). While stratospheric ozone protects against UV radiation, ground-level ozone is harmful to lung function, causing irritation, reduced lung capacity, and exacerbated asthma and chronic respiratory diseases.'
